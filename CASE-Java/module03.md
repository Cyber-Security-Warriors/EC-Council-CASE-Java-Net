# Secure Application Design and Architecture

 Secure Design Principles helps to eliminate design and architecture flaws and mitigate common security vulnerabilities within the application.
 * Fail Securely
 * Apply Defense in Depth
 * Do Not Trust User Input


## Threat Modeling Phases


* **Attack Surface Evaluation :** Application is decomposed and its entry points are reviewed from an attackerâ€™s perspective. 
* **Threat Identification :** Each entry points are then reviewed against potential threats 
* **Impact Analysis :** Impact of potential threats is calculated in terms of risk 
* **Control Recommendations :** Security controls are recommended to meet security objectives

## Perform Application Modeling using Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)

The collected information such as external entities, entry points, assets and trust level will help in accurately modeling the application by using Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs).
