# Importance of Gathering Security Requirements

Software security requirements are ***non functional*** requirements, which need to be addressed to maintain the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of the application



## Different Approach for Security Requirements Gathering


* A software needs to be viewed in a more **negative, critical, and destructive** way to reveal its non-intended use and its associated security requirements.
* Functional requirements are **positive requirements** specifying what the software should do.
* Security requirements are **negative requirements** specifying what the software should not do

## Good Security Requirement: SMART

* **Specific :** Wording of the software requirement should be clear and precise. It should not be vague and all-encompassing 
* **Measurable/Testable :**  There should be a clear way to test whether the specific requirement was met or not 
* **Actionable :** Developer should get clear understanding of what they exactly need to do to satisfy the requirements of the client 
* **Realistic :** It should be implementable in real time considering all the constraints 
* **Timely :** It should be of high priority when it is decided to implement

## Security Requirement Engineering (SRE) 

SRE plays a major role in integrated security software development lifecycle process.
Typical SRE approaches are broadly classified into:
* **Derived approach:** It is derived from traditional requirement gathering approach (use case modeling) to address security requirements in software development process 
* **Dedicated approach:** It is developed specifically to address security requirements

## Abuse Cases

* ***Abuse cases (or misuse case)*** derived from **use cases** of software system.
* Abuse cases capture **abnormal behavior** of the system
* Abuse cases lay the foundation for **threat modeling** 
* The ***“threaten” relationship*** is used to describe **abuse case** scenario 
* **Abuser stories** are the user stories written from the point of view of a malicious adversary

## Security Use Cases

* Security use cases are derived from abuse cases 
* It uncovers software abuse cases and its response
* **Mitigates Relationship** provides **countermeasures** to uncover the abuse case

## Security Quality Requirements Engineering (SQUARE) 

* Security Quality Requirements Engineering (SQUARE) provides a means for **eliciting, categorizing, and prioritizing** security requirements for information technology systems and applications
* Inexpensive to implement
* Only useful for large projects (disadvantage)

## Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE)Synchronization
* OCTAVE is an information risk evaluation method that enables organizations to determine the risk factors affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets.
* Structured approach for identifying, prioritizing, and managing the security risks in an organization
* It is **difficult to understand and implement** the concepts of OCTAVE approach (Disadvantage)
* The approach does not provide a detailed explanation of the **quantitative analysis** of the security risks in the organization(Disadvantage)
